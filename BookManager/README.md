# ExtensionMethodExamples

Background for this project was an article by Matt Eland at this address:

https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-extension-methods-in-c-to-build-fluent-code-1735fbc9b525

I did not understand the dependencies among each other. So I created this project to see which class does what. I have deliberately omitted the class bookbuilder.
