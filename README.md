# ExtensionMethodExamples

My base for experimenting with extension methods in C#.

First project here is BookManager based on an article by Matt Eland under
https://levelup.gitconnected.com/using-extension-methods-in-c-to-build-fluent-code-1735fbc9b525

Further details see in README of BookManager.
